Generative AI models are quickly becoming adept at handling many routine tasks, and some experts say they are already on par with human software engineers, for instance.\nThat has sparked concerns that while automation will make companies more productive and enrich shareholders, swaths of the job market could be impacted in the coming years.\nTechnology executives have recently become more candid about the impact of AI on employees. Companies including Alphabet and Microsoft have said AI is producing roughly 30% of the code on some projects, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in June that AI handles as much as 50% of the work at his company.\nYoung tech workers, whose jobs are the easiest to automate, are the first concrete signs of displacement, according to Briggs.\nUnemployment rates among tech workers between 20 and 30 years old jumped by 3 percentage points since the start of this year, he said. Briggs recently co-authored a report titled \"Quantifying the Risks of AI-Related Job Displacement\" that cites labor market data from IPUMS and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.\n\"This is a much larger increase than we've seen in the tech sector more broadly [and] a larger increase than we've seen for other young workers,\" he said.", "19b58049b799e1adc9e213eab72e431d": "Lucid Group on Tuesday softened its production outlook for the rest of the year as it reported second-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street expectations.\nThe electric vehicle maker now anticipates producing between 18,000 and 20,000 vehicles for the year after previously projecting a goal of 20,000.\nInterim CEO Marc Winterhoff told CNBC on Tuesday that the company is still aiming for the high end of that range.\n\"I have never seen so many surprises within a year as this year,\" he said. \"So all of those plans are still set up for where we were before, but we just want to be a little bit more cautious and, therefore, provide a range.\"\nShares of Lucid fell more than 7% in after-hours trading Tuesday.\nHere's what the company reported in the three-month period that ended on June 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\nLoss per share: 24 cents adjusted vs. a loss of 21 cents expected\n24 cents adjusted vs. a loss of 21 cents expected Revenue: $259 million vs. $280 million expected\nThe company reported a net loss for the quarter of $855 million, or 28 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $790 million, or 34 cents per share, in the same period last year. Excluding restructuring and other one-time costs, the company posted an adjusted loss per share of 24 cents for the quarter.\nLucid's total costs and expenses were up roughly 7.5% from the same period last year, at $1.06 billion.\nThe automaker said it ended the quarter with roughly $4.86 billion in total liquidity.\n\"We are focused on business fundamentals to achieve our near-term goals: disciplined cost management, brand building, and continuing to execute our Lucid Gravity launch ramp,\" Chief Financial Officer Taoufiq Boussaid said in a release.\nLast month, Lucid announced Uber would invest $300 million in the company as part of a partnership to deploy more than 20,000 robotaxis over the next six years. It's also been trying to build its brand awareness, in part by tapping actor Timothée Chalamet to star in a new ad campaign.\nBut Lucid has been burning through cash as it works to ramp up production of its Gravity SUV, its second vehicle after the Air sedan. Winterhoff said he had hoped to be further along in ramping up the Gravity's production at this point in the year, but that the company was still facing some supply chain constraints.\nLucid said in July that it delivered 3,309 vehicles in the second quarter, a 38.2% increase compared with the same period in 2024, but short of analysts' expectations.\nDemand for pure electric vehicles has been slower than expected, and consumers have been gravitating toward cheaper hybrids.\nThe industry is also bracing for the effects of President Donald Trump's new tax-and-spending bill, which he signed into law on July 4. That legislation is set to end the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles and $4,000 credit for used EVs after Sept. 30.\nLucid stock has fallen nearly 19% so far this year as of Tuesday's close.", "fce48a9ea13287be0591a0faacd491a5": "Lisa Su, CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, and Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, testifiy during the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing titled \"Winning the AI Race: Strengthening U.S. Capabilities in Computing and Innovation,\" in Hart building on Thursday, May 8, 2025.\nAdvanced Micro Devices reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday that missed estimates. The stock slid about 5% in extended trading.\nHere's how the chipmaker did versus LSEG expectations for the quarter that ended in June:\nEarnings per share : 48 cents adjusted vs. 49 cents expected\n: 48 cents adjusted vs. 49 cents expected Revenue: $7.69 billion vs. $7.42 billion expected\nFor the current quarter, AMD expects sales of $8.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million, versus expectations of earnings of $8.3 billion.\nAMD reported net income during its fiscal second quarter of $872 million, or 54 cents per share, increasing from $265 million, or 16 cents per share in the year-ago period. Nvidia's overall sales rose 32% in the period from $5.84 billion a year earlier.\nAMD is the second-biggest maker of graphics processing units, or GPUs, for artificial intelligence behind Nvidia , which has the vast majority of the market. But big AI customers such as Meta and OpenAI are increasingly looking to AMD to provide an alternative to Nvidia's pricey chips, especially for inference, or when AI models are deployed to the public.\nDuring the quarter, AMD announced new AI chips called the Instinct MI400 that are expected to hit the market next year. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman committed to using AMD's newest GPUs.\nAMD is also grappling with chip export controls that have been placed on some of its AI chips because the U.S. government worries that powerful GPUs could be used by adversaries to surpass American capabilities or be used for military purposes.\n\"AI business revenue declined year over year as U.S. export restrictions effectively eliminated MI308 sales to China, and we began transitioning to our next generation,\" AMD CEO Lisa Su said on a call with analysts.\nThe MI308 was previously barred for export to China in April, which the company said cost it $800 million in the June quarter. However, the company said in July that it expected shipments to resume after the Trump administration signaled that it would approve waivers. AMD said its outlook doesn't include any revenue from its China-focused AI chip called the MI308 and its license applications are currently being reviewed by the Department of Commerce. Su said she expected AI revenue to grow year over year in the current quarter.", "79537a9ad2c333cc919a27fc3b2f3e6d": "Sam Altman’s blowtorch to his competitors is so hot, it even includes a new partnership with Amazon Web Services.\nAs OpenAI announced two open-weight reasoning models with capabilities on par with its o-series, Amazon announced that the new models would become available on AWS on Tuesday. This is the first time that OpenAI models will be offered by AWS, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. They will be available as a model choice with Amazon AI services Bedrock and SageMaker AI.\nWhile anyone can download the models via Hugging Face, Amazon is offering these models with OpenAI’s full knowledge and approval, as Dmitry Pimenov, the model maker’s product lead, indicated in the announcement. A spokesperson described the offering as similar to how Amazon offered open model DeepSeek-R1 earlier this year.\nThis is a juicy competitive move for both companies. For AWS, it finally puts the cloud giant in the same sentence as the biggest model maker, OpenAI.\nUntil now, AWS has best been known as a major host and a financial backer of Anthropic’s Claude, one of OpenAI’s biggest competitors. AWS offers Claude, along with other models from makers such as Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, and Mistral, as well as its own home-grown ones in its AI services. Specifically, Bedrock allows AWS customers to build and host generative AI apps using models of their choice. SageMaker, on the other hand, allows AWS customers to train, or even build, their own AI models largely for analytics uses.\nWhile AWS’s ultimate rival, Microsoft, hasn’t had a lock on OpenAI models since January, Azure is still OpenAI’s most significant cloud partner to date. OpenAI even announced that Microsoft is offering versions of these two new models, too, optimized for Windows devices.\nWatching Microsoft win an increasing amount of cloud business with OpenAI has been a public pain in Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s neck. Just last week during Amazon’s quarterly earnings call, Jassy was pounded with questions from Wall Street analysts about how the company was losing ground in AI to competitors, particularly Microsoft.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nFor instance, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth asked Jassy to explain “significantly faster cloud growth among the number two and number three players in the space,” referring to Microsoft and Google. Later, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak told Jassy that Wall Street thinks “AWS is falling behind in GenAI with concerns about share loss, peers, etc.”\nJassy responded with a minutes-long diatribe that included this barb at Redmond: “I think the second player is about 65% of the size of the AWS.”\nMeanwhile, another AWS competitor, Oracle, reported that it signed a $30 billion a year deal with OpenAI to offer data center services. This means that OpenAI plans to pay Oracle more each year than all of its other cloud services customers combined. Until now, AWS had been left out of any OpenAI-related glory.\nAs for how such a move with AWS benefits OpenAI: The AI provider’s relationship with Microsoft is notoriously strained, as the two are reportedly renegotiating their long-term partnership deal. What better way for OpenAI to strengthen its position than to cozy up the biggest cloud provider, even if, initially, on a small scale?\nIn addition, this partnership allows swaths of AWS enterprise customers to easily experiment with using OpenAI models with their hosted AI apps.\nMeanwhile Altman gets to undercut Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg with this move as well. As OpenAI releases these two high-performing models under an Apache 2.0 open source license, Meta recently admitted that it probably won’t continue to open source all of its upcoming “superintelligence” models."}
